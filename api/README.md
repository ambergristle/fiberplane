## Running mizu

> You'll want to follow the instructions in `Configuring Neon (the Database)` before running the app

```sh
npm install

# NOTE - Before running db migrations, you need to follow the instructions in `Configuring Neon (the Database)`

npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate

# NOTE - This app runs Hono in a Node.js execution context by default,
#        Since we need access to the filesystem to do fun stuff
npm run dev 
```

### Configuring Neon (the Database)

Neon commands! This can help set up or configure a neon database for project named `mizu`, where you can store telemetry data.

```sh
# Authenticate with neon cli
neonctl auth

# Create project if you haven't already
#
# > *skip this* if you already created a project,
# > and grab the DATABASE_URL from your dashbaord
PROJECT_NAME=mizu
neonctl projects create --name $PROJECT_NAME --set-context

# Finally, add connection string to .dev.vars
DATABASE_URL=$(neonctl connection-string)
echo -e '\nDATABASE_URL='$DATABASE_URL'\n' >> .dev.vars
```

### Adding some AI

- Get an OpenAI API Key
- Add it to `.dev.vars`
- Voil√†

## Otlp (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

This would be how to run an otel collector with the config file in this repo:

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.100.0
```
