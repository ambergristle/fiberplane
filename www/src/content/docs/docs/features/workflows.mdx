Workflows allow you to chain a series of API requests to automate complex processes through a single endpoint. This guide covers the key features of workflows and how to use them effectively.

## What Are Workflows?

Workflows are sequences of API operations that can be triggered with a single request. They enable you to:

- Chain multiple API requests in a specific order
- Pass data between steps automatically
- Execute complex business logic without multiple client-server roundtrips
- Create reusable processes for common operations

<Aside type="caution">
  Workflows are currently in alpha. They should only be used with trusted API users.

## Authentication Requirements

To use workflows, you need two key elements:

1. **Fiberplane API Key**: The API owner must configure this in their backend. Request access via Discord.

2. **Partition Key**: Created by the API owner for individual users or organizations. This controls access to specific workflows.

The Workflows tab provides a management interface where you can:

- View all existing workflows and what steps they do
- Test workflows with sample data
- Delete workflows that are no longer needed

## Creating Workflows Using Natural Language

The quickest way to create a workflow is with natural language instructions:

1. Open the Workflows tab in the Playground
2. Click the `+` button to create a new workflow
3. Describe what you want the workflow to do
4. Fiberplane will generate a workflow based on your prompt and API's OpenAPI schema

## Using Workflows

Once created, each workflow gets a unique ID and becomes accessible at:

```
<base_url>/<fiberplane_mount_path>/w/<workflow_id>
```

For example, if Fiberplane is mounted at `/fp` and your workflow ID is `createAndUpdateUser`, the endpoint would be:

```
https://example.com/fp/w/createAndUpdateUser
```

### Making Workflow Requests

To execute a workflow:

1. Send a POST request to the workflow endpoint
2. Include a JSON payload with all required inputs:

```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "userName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

The workflow runner will:
- Handle all intermediate API calls
- Manage data flow between steps
- Return the final result

<Aside type="tip">
  The `inputs` object must include all parameters needed at any step in the workflow, including any required headers.
