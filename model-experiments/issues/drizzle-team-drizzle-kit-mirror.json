just did a rather large migration where I renamed one of the core concepts in my application. This resulted in multiple tables (e.g., `houses` became `buildings`) and a few properties on those tables (e.g., `house_id` became `building_id`) being renamed.\r\n\r\nAfter running `drizzle-kit generate`, I was asked which tables to drop/rename, and I selected all the relevant tables there.

reproduction instructions\r\n\r\nStart from a naive schema that contains an `pgEnum`\r\n```ts\r\nimport {\r\n  pgTable,\r\n  uuid,\r\n  pgEnum,\r\n} from \"drizzle-orm/pg-core\";\r\n\r\nexport const statusEnum = pgEnum(\"status\", [\r\n  \"active\",\r\n  \"inactive\",\r\n]);\r\n\r\nexport const persons = pgTable(\"user\", {\r\n  id: uuid(\"id\").primaryKey(),\r\n  status: statusEnum(\"status\"),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerate the migration by running `drizzle-kit generate`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click here to see the generated migration</summary>\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDO $$ BEGIN\r\n CREATE TYPE \"public\".\"status\" AS ENUM('active', 'inactive');\r\nEXCEPTION\r\n WHEN duplicate_object THEN null;\r\nEND $$;\r\n--> statement-breakpoint\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"user\" (\r\n\t\"id\" uuid PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"status\" \"status\"\r\n);\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThen, rename the enum and make no other changes to the database.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const statusEnum = pgEnum(\"newName\", [\r\n  \"active\",\r\n  \"inactive\",\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior here is that it renames the enum, and indeed, when you run `drizzle-kit generate` it asks if the field was renamed. Select the rename option (vs. the 'its new' option, it works fine)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npx drizzle-kit generate\r\ndrizzle-kit: v0.21.4\r\ndrizzle-orm: v0.30.10\r\n\r\nNo config path provided, using default 'drizzle.config.ts'\r\nReading config file 'drizzle.config.ts'\r\n~ status › newName enum will be renamed/moved\r\n--- all enum conflicts resolved ---\r\n\r\n1 tables\r\nuser 2 columns 0 indexes 0 fks\r\n\r\nNo schema changes, nothing to migrate 😴\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt identifies that there's a rename to do, says \"enum will be renamed\" and then exits with no schema changes. This seems to be because it decides that no SQL needs to be emitted.\r\n\r\nNow, the problem: because that does not result in an update to the `snapshot` state, the next time you run, it asks the same question. \r\n\r\nOn a team with multiple engineers contributing schema changes, it effectively defers that original decision (\"was this renamed?\") to the next engineer who makes a change.\r\n\r\nI think if there's no SQL emitted, it should generate a blank or no-op SQL file and an updated snapshot anyway. That way the state of the codebase can adequately capture the decision made (and, e.g., be committed to git).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/444/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/444/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/443","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/443/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/443/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/443/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/443","id":2325615029,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M6KnhG1","number":443,"title":"proposal:

an issue with `esbuild-register` that's impacting our ability to use drizzle-kit, the TL;DR; is esbuild-register doesn't seem to [resolve the project's tsconfig file correctly](https://github.com/egoist/esbuild-register/issues/38).\r\n\r\nDid some instrumenting and observed that it fails to bubble up looking for a `tsconfig.json` for the project when running `drizzle-kit`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nReading config file '/Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/libs/database/drizzle.config.ts'\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/libs/database/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/tsconfig.json\r\nloading /Users/jack/dev/marketplace/backend/configs/application/tsconfig.json\r\nError: Transform failed with 4 errors:\r\n ... ERROR: Transforming JavaScript decorators to the configured target environment (\"es2021\") is not supported yet\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like `esbuild-register` searches the local directory of the file under compilation for a `tsconfig.json`, and if not found, uses the default tsconfig settings. Our problem is that `backend` is a nest project that makes heavy use of decorators. `experimentalDecorators` is not a default tsconfig option and hence esbuild fails to compile the drizzle config file.\r\n\r\nThe original `esbuild-register` issue suggested this can be worked around by doing the tsconfig resolution yourself and passing that as an option to esbuild, bypassing its resolution of the `tsconfig.json`.

the DDL statements executed during a migration will greatly help troubleshooting, debugging, and manually recovering from a failed migration.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour just appears to log the last error received from the database driver. If the error contains some identifiable context, maybe that helps, but if the error is more generic, we are completely lost.\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour when an error occurs:\r\n- We don't know which migration files were executed (ie. `0012_funky_horse_calipers.sql` worked but `0013_sad_panda_noises.sql` failed)\r\n- We don't know which DDL statement within a migration fail caused the error.\r\n\r\nI suggest that when `config.verbose` is false, the `migrate` command should just log the name of each migration file before its DDL statements are executed.

Object.values(it.columns).map((col) => {\r\n  let patched = importsPatch[col.type] ?? col.type;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"varchar(\") ? \"varchar\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"char(\") ? \"char\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"binary(\") ? \"binary\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"decimal(\") ? \"decimal\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"smallint(\") ? \"smallint\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"enum(\") ? \"mysqlEnum\" : patched;\r\n  patched = patched.startsWith(\"datetime(\") ?

patched;\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf a column uses type double, import is correctly inserted.\r\n\r\n### Patch\r\n\r\nThe following patch can be applied as a workaround until this issue is resolved.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/bin.cjs b/bin.cjs\r\nindex fef2511d2e2d69c877fc925c281d88aa828f150f..12c700646dd7e88184b6a38f604d26f3fa32953a 100755\r\n--- a/bin.cjs\r\n+++

being properly migrated, and are left referencing the __old_push_ version of the target table (which I assume only exists for a short time during the push:sqlite process)\r\n\r\n## Work Around:\r\nThe foriegn keys were not really neccessary in my case, so I just removed the .references() calls in the schema and everything works now, but I imagine that wont be a good solution for everyone.

wanted to file an issue for the [discussion we had on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IanMitchel1/status/1779559528058823010) about this problem!\r\n\r\nWhen using the bigint type with PlanetScale or other HTTP drivers there needs to be a translation to convert a bigint into a JSON serializable value. With `drizzle-orm`, this is accomplished with the `cast` optional config parameter:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction inflate(field: Field, value: string | null) {\r\n\tif (field.type === \"INT64\" || field.type === \"UINT64\") {\r\n\t\treturn BigInt(value ?? 0);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn cast(field, value);\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst client = new Client({\r\n\thost: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,\r\n\tusername: process.env.DATABASE_USERNAME,\r\n\tpassword: process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,\r\n\tcast: inflate,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when using `drizzle-kit`, this option doesn't appear to exist. This results in errors when trying to create a table migration with a bigint column that has a default value set on it (JavaScript doesn't know how to serialize the value into JSON).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nflags: bigint(\"flags\", { mode: \"bigint\", unsigned: true }).notNull().default(0n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can kind of work around this via `.$defaultFn(() => 0n)`, but you lose out on your database schema enforcing a non-null value. Ideally a cast option would be added to the drizzle-kit configuration options that would allow me to pass in the same `inflate` function!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358","id":2235452718,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M6FPk0u","number":358,"title":"(Feat Studio): Refresh studio when schema changes","user":{"login":"juliomuhlbauer","id":53458125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDU4MTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53458125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer","html_url":"https://github.com/juliomuhlbauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliomuhlbauer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-04-10T12:13:01Z","updated_at":"2024-04-16T19:51:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/357","id":2233574189,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M6FIaMt","number":357,"title":"MySQL DrizzleKit generating failing ALTER TABLE statements in migrations that doesn't include schema name.","user":{"login":"GustavLjungberg","id":151726480,"node_id":"U_kgDOCQspkA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/151726480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg","html_url":"https://github.com/GustavLjungberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GustavLjungberg/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-04-09T14:25:56Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T07:12:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Drizzle-kit generates failing migrations on MySQL databases that includes schemas (or databases as mysql calls them) for separating tables.\r\n\r\nAfter looking into the code a bit it seems that this affects these types of statements:\r\n- DROP TABLE\r\n- ALTER TABLE ...

PostGIS extension is a **very** commonly adopted extension that is used in PostgreSQL databases so lat/lon coordinates can be stored and searches can be run to find records within a particular radius, such as nearby store locations or the closest location.\r\n\r\nAssuming that PostGIS as well as PostgreSQL is installed on your database server, you can add the PostGIS extension into a PostgreSQL database by executing the following SQL against your db:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE EXTENSION postgis;\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `drizzle-kit introspect:pg` after creating the PostGIS extension will generate a schema.ts file, but it is unusable and will cause reference errors to be thrown when trying to initialize Drizzle since Drizzle didn't recognize some of the geographic and geographic data types when trying to introspect the database. I've been able to test Drizzle working fine with a non-geographic custom table in a test database then adding in the extension with no other changes and seeing the reference errors in schema.ts when trying to introspect again.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reference errors for the extension itself, any attempt to store lat/lon coordinates as geometry points in your custom tables will also fail as introspection doesn't recognize those either. For example the `location` field below will have an unknown datatype in your schema if you try the following:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE \"Example\"\r\n(\r\n    id SERIAL NOT NULL,\r\n    name CHARACTER VARYING(123),\r\n    location GEOMETRY(POINT)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the many folks who have existing PostgreSQL databases with PostGIS extensions, this would be a show-stopper when it comes to adopting Drizzle. I'm very keen to use it myself on a couple of projects (Drizzle is mindblowingly awesome!) and would happily adopt it if Drizzle was usable with PostGIS.

I want *tag_id* to be the first key of the composite key.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nRenaming the columns, so that they are alphabetically in the correct order fixes this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const recipeHasTags = sqliteTable('recipe_has_tags', {\r\n\trecipeId: integer('pk2_recipe_id').references(() => recipes.id).notNull(),\r\n\ttagId: integer('pk1_tag_id').references(() => tags.id).notNull(),\r\n}, (table) => {\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tpk: primaryKey({ columns: [table.tagId, table.recipeId] }),\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces the result I want, which is\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nPRIMARY KEY(`pk1_tag_id`, `pk2_recipe_id`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut obviously the order should not be derived from the names of the columns.\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is my project in a zip file:\r\n\r\n[migration_bug.zip](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/files/14666730/migration_bug.zip)\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, just run `pnpm install` and then `pnpm migrate`.

have been trying to get Drizzle working with Docker but no luck.\r\n\r\nEvery other framework has solutions for it but Drizzle lacks them.\r\n\r\nI think what Drizzle Kit needs is a solution provided in these 2 blogs:\r\n\r\n1. https://notiz.dev/blog/dockerizing-nestjs-with-prisma-and-postgresql\r\n2. https://notiz.dev/blog/prisma-migrate-deploy-with-docker\r\n\r\nThe example is Prisma with Nestjs but it probably would work with Drizzle & Next.js.\r\n\r\nI've been trying for a week to get Docker running on my simple SQLite + Next.js project but so far have been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason is Drizzle doesn't provide direct migrate command but instead wants me to rely on `tsx` which again breaks the build near the end as Dockerfile can't find `tsx` at the end.\r\n\r\nSmallest Reproduction -> https://github.com/deadcoder0904/easypanel-nextjs-sqlite\r\n\r\nThis project works well in Development & would definitely work well in Production if I can get the migrate command.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I can think of only 1 solution:\r\n\r\n1. Use bun.sh (as a `tsx` replacement) but it won't be available on Windows until 1 or 2 weeks anyways.\r\n\r\nIf there's any other solutions that anyone got Drizzle Migrations working with SQLite on a Next.js app, I'd love to know? I've found a couple of projects on Github but they do it in a very complicated manner.\r\n\r\nI think the reason is because Drizzle Migrate doesn't exist as a command.\r\n\r\nHere's how tsx fails:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n> easypanel-nextjs-sqlite@0.1.0 start\r\n> npm run db:migrate:prod && next start\r\n\r\n\r\n> easypanel-nextjs-sqlite@0.1.0 db:migrate:prod\r\n> node --import tsx --env-file .env.production ./scripts/drizzle-migrate.ts\r\n\r\nnode:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853\r\n  throw new ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND(packageName, fileURLToPath(base), null);\r\n        ^\r\n\r\nError [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'tsx' imported from /app/\r\n    at packageResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853:9)\r\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:910:20)\r\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:1130:11)\r\n    at ModuleLoader.defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:396:12)\r\n    at ModuleLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:365:25)\r\n    at ModuleLoader.getModuleJob (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:240:38)\r\n    at ModuleLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:328:34)\r\n    at loadESM (node:internal/process/esm_loader:23:33)\r\n    at runMainESM (node:internal/modules/run_main:98:21)\r\n    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (node:internal/modules/run_main:131:5) {\r\n  code: 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND'\r\n}\r\n\r\nNode.js v20.11.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is inside `Dockerfile` otherwise I would've installed `tsx` locally. I've also installed in dependency instead of devDependency.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/317","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/317/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/317/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/317/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/317","id":2130768172,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M5_APEs","number":317,"title":"Most commands fail with missing drizzle-studio/localhost-key.pem","user":{"login":"jckw","id":11884004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg0MDA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11884004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw","html_url":"https://github.com/jckw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jckw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2024-02-12T19:01:14Z","updated_at":"2024-05-11T10:38:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I'm new to Drizzle and setting up a project with a blank DB.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `yarn drizzle-kit generate:pg` it fails with an error regarding a missing key from drizzle-studio.

am experiencing a recurring problem with Drizzle ORM when attempting to update the default value of the 'image' column in my PostgreSQL 'posts' table. Despite repeatedly running the update command, the change is not applied, and I am prompted each time to confirm the execution without any actual effect.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n1. Initially define the 'posts' table with an 'image' column, setting a default value using Drizzle ORM.\r\n2. Change the default value of the 'image' column and execute the `push:pg` command to apply updates.\r\n3. Observe that the command prompts for confirmation to execute the changes.\r\n4. After confirming, notice that the expected changes are not applied to the database.\r\n5. On subsequent executions of the `push:pg` command, the same prompt appears and confirmation is requested, but the changes still do not take effect.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nThe default value for the 'image' column in the 'posts' table should update according to the modified schema in Drizzle ORM, and the change should be reflected in the PostgreSQL database after executing the `push:pg` command.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\nDespite confirming the execution of the `push:pg` command multiple times, the default value for the 'image' column remains unchanged. The command consistently prompts for confirmation as if the change has not been previously applied.\r\n\r\n**Code Snippet:**\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const posts = pgTable(\r\n  \"posts\",\r\n  {\r\n    ...\r\n    image: varchar(\"image\", { length: 500 }).notNull().default(\"\"),\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  ...\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Command Used:**\r\n```bash\r\nnpx drizzle-kit push:pg --config drizzle.pg.config.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepeatedly executing this command results in the following prompt without resolving the issue:\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE \"posts\" ALTER COLUMN \"image\" SET DEFAULT '';\r\n\r\n  No, abort\r\n❯ Yes, I want to execute all statements\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version Information:**\r\n- drizzle-kit: v0.20.10\r\n- drizzle-orm: v0.29.3","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/287/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/287/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/287/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/287","id":2076713755,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M57yCMb","number":287,"title":"Drizzle Studio Logs escaping ANSI color codes VSCode","user":{"login":"scottsmith-1","id":141334713,"node_id":"U_kgDOCGyYuQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/141334713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1","html_url":"https://github.com/scottsmith-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottsmith-1/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-01-11T13:51:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T13:51:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"![image](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/assets/141334713/74ee9732-f918-48a1-9b3e-f95f32686f0a)\r\n\r\nNot sure if I'm doing something wrong or if Drizzle Studio does something to escape the color codes.

thank you for the hard work you guys are putting in for Drizzle.\r\nSo, I am saving my timestamp/datetime values in \"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\" format, i.e, \"2023-12-25 16:00:00\"\r\nand using that value to by the unique/primary key for one of my tables\r\nIt works great, but there are some issues arising when using Drizzle Kit Studio\r\nit seems like in Studio, these timestamp/datetime formats are getting cast to ISO format\r\nfor example: \"2023-12-25T16:00:00.000Z\"\r\nthis is how it looks in Web view: \r\n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/assets/8712657/7239673b-6902-4178-a98c-609acfc0e9b7\">\r\nand when you try to delete the row, it will not properly match the original datetime format, and instead use the ISO string for the query, hence it will fail.\r\nUsing the `--verbose` flag for drizzle kit studio, the query invoked becomes:\r\n`Query: delete from \"day\" where \"data_at\" = ? -- params: [\"2023-12-25T16:00:00.000Z\"]`\r\nthe correct query should be:\r\n`delete from \"day\" where \"data_at\" = \"2023-12-25 16:00:00\"`\r\n\r\nWhat I'm using:\r\ndrizzle-kit:

Accidentally pushed it to the wrong repo.\r\n\r\n### What version of `drizzle-orm` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.29.1\r\n\r\n### What version of `drizzle-kit` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.20.6\r\n\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nI am new to drizzle. I tried to create tables in separate, custom schema, using the examples from official [github](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/tree/main/examples/pg-proxy) and custom schema usage from [official documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/schemas). Generation of the schema works fine but when I try to migrate a postgres database I get:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run migrate\r\n\r\n> pg-proxy@1.0.0 migrate\r\n> drizzle-kit push:pg\r\n\r\ndrizzle-kit: v0.20.6\r\ndrizzle-orm: v0.29.1\r\n\r\nNo config path provided, using default path\r\nReading config file '/Users/<USER>/repos/opensource/pg-proxy/drizzle.config.ts'\r\n[i] No changes detected\r\n```\r\n\r\nSchema is:\r\n`schema.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { pgSchema, serial, text } from \"drizzle-orm/pg-core\";\r\n\r\nconst mySchema = pgSchema('test');\r\n\r\nexport const users = mySchema.table(\"users\", {\r\n  id: serial(\"id\").primaryKey(),\r\n  name: text(\"name\").notNull(),\r\n  email: text(\"email\").notNull(),\r\n  cityId: serial(\"city_id\").references(() => cities.id),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport const cities = mySchema.table(\"cities\", {\r\n  id: serial(\"id\").primaryKey(),\r\n  name: text(\"name\").notNull(),\r\n});\r\n```\r\nNotice that the database is empty, just created using docker-compose. The `drizzle-kit generate:pg --schema src/schema.ts` command produces following schemas:\r\n`0000_futuristic_devos.sql`\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"test\".\"cities\" (\r\n\t\"id\" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"name\" text NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n--> statement-breakpoint\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"test\".\"users\" (\r\n\t\"id\" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"name\" text NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"email\" text NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"city_id\" serial NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n--> statement-breakpoint\r\nDO $$ BEGIN\r\n ALTER TABLE \"test\".\"users\" ADD CONSTRAINT \"users_city_id_cities_id_fk\" FOREIGN KEY (\"city_id\") REFERENCES \"test\".\"cities\"(\"id\") ON DELETE no action ON UPDATE no action;\r\nEXCEPTION\r\n WHEN duplicate_object THEN null;\r\nEND $$;\r\n```\r\nNotice how the produced SQL does not have any schema-related creations. it just tries to create a table in the `test` schema.\r\nIt is strange why does `generate` command does not create a `test` schema first and only then creates tables inside of this schema. Maybe this is an expected behaviour and custom schema should be created beforehand in a separate schema or something?\r\nIf I change `schema.ts` to this:\r\n`schema.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { pgTable, serial, text } from \"drizzle-orm/pg-core\";\r\n\r\nexport const users = pgTable(\"users\", {\r\n  id: serial(\"id\").primaryKey(),\r\n  name: text(\"name\").notNull(),\r\n  email: text(\"email\").notNull(),\r\n  cityId: serial(\"city_id\").references(() => cities.id),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport const cities = pgTable(\"cities\", {\r\n  id: serial(\"id\").primaryKey(),\r\n  name: text(\"name\").notNull(),\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThen delete migration files, regenerate them and migrate everything works as expected and migrations are applied.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `drizzle-kit push:pg` command to create a custom schema, tables inside this schema or at least tell me what is the issue and why after running this command I don't see any changes in the DB.\r\n\r\n### Environment & setup\r\n\r\nHardware: MacBook Pro (m1)\r\nSystem Version:\tmacOS 14.1.1 (23B81)\r\nPostgres version: 15.5\r\nRuntime: npm 9.8.1, node v18.18.2\r\n\r\n`drizzle.config.ts`\r\n```ts\r\nimport { defineConfig, type Config } from \"drizzle-kit\";\r\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\r\n\r\n// DB_URL is postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5431/bug?search_path=test\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  schema: \"src/schema.ts\",\r\n  out: \"drizzle\",\r\n  driver: \"pg\",\r\n  dbCredentials: {\r\n

As a temporary solution we just need an argument to tell the kit to emit JS for the \"lts\" Node in ESM format for those who need it.\r\nhttps://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/55#issuecomment-1813592154","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/246/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245","id":2001311832,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M53SZhY","number":245,"title":"Studio Feature Request: focus search when opening Open a Table page in Drizzle Studio","user":{"login":"suraj5969","id":58414924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDE0OTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58414924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969","html_url":"https://github.com/suraj5969","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/suraj5969/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-11-20T03:53:03Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T03:53:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"when I click on + button in drizzle studio to open a new table, can we focus search for quick searching of tables,\r\nand also, It would be great if we could have keyboard navigation, up and down arrow for selecting table and enter to open a table","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/244","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/244/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/244/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/244/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/244","id":2001249641,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M53SKVp","number":244,"title":"Drizzle Studio and Safari - how to make drizzle-kit studio use self-signed cert?","user":{"login":"cxreiff","id":8195503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTU1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8195503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff","html_url":"https://github.com/cxreiff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cxreiff/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-11-20T02:36:02Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T02:36:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I'm attempting to use Drizzle Studio in Safari.

Description:**\r\n\r\nAfter a recent update to drizzle-kit 0.20.0, we've encountered a critical issue where generating new SQL migrations results in the unintended dropping of all tables, with the exception of the last declared schema. This behavior is unexpected and deviates from our previous migrations, where all schemas were recognized and preserved accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Configuration:**\r\n\r\nWe are utilizing the following configuration for our migrations:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  schema: \"./schema/*\",\r\n  out: \"./drizzle\",\r\n  driver: \"pg\",\r\n  dbCredentials: {\r\n    connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur schema is based on the following structure:\r\n```\r\nschema\r\n├── enums\r\n│   └── enums.ts\r\n├── shared\r\n│   └── timestampColumns.ts\r\n└── tables\r\n    ├── bookingResources.ts\r\n    ├── bookingServices.ts\r\n    ├── ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior upon generating migrations would be the recognition of all declared schemas and the preservation of their respective tables in the database.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\n\r\nOnly the last declared schema is recognized, and as a result, only one table remains post-migration, leading to the loss of all other tables.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\nUpdate drizzle-kit to the latest version (0.20.0).\r\nRun the command to generate new SQL migrations.\r\nObserve that all tables except for the last one declared in the schema are dropped.\r\nImpact:\r\n\r\nThis issue is critically impacting our development workflow and potentially could affect our production environment if not addressed promptly.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context:**\r\n\r\nThis problem began after updating drizzle-kit to 0.20.0.\r\nNo errors are thrown during the migration generation; the tables are simply dropped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/229/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228","id":1985671293,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M52WvB9","number":228,"title":"issue","user":{"login":"ModAllama","id":84066808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDY2ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84066808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama","html_url":"https://github.com/ModAllama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ModAllama/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-11-09T13:51:41Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T13:51:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I run that==> \"Drizzle Studio is up and running on http://0.0.0.0:4983\"\r\n\r\n\r\ni get that ==>\"This site can’t be reachedThe webpage at http://0.0.0.0:4983/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.\r\nERR_ADDRESS_INVALID\r\n\"","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/227","id":1984545646,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M52ScNu","number":227,"title":"There are three cases where drizzle-kit's introspect:mysql does not work.

solution/work-around for now is to separate the custom column types, and use relative import paths, but it would be good if drizzle-kit didn't need that.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was way for drizzle-kit to understand import aliases. Either from the real tsconfig.json (which is complicated a little by sveltekit which uses `extends` to reference a file in `./.sveltekit/tsconfig.json` which defines the aliases:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"compilerOptions\": {\r\n\t\t\"paths\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"$db\": [ \"../src/lib/server/db\" ],\r\n\t\t\t\"$db/*\": [ \"../src/lib/server/db/*\" ],\r\n\t\t\t\"$lib\": [

This issue was also added in https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1435\r\n\r\n### What version of `drizzle-orm` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.28.6\r\n\r\n### What version of `drizzle-kit` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.19.13\r\n\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nDefining two tables that have the same name, but are in different schemas, will result in one of them overriding the other. As a result a migration for only one of the tables is created.\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nconst customSchema = pgSchema('custom')\r\n\r\nexport const customTableA = customSchema.table('table_a',\r\n\t{id: uuid('id').primaryKey()}\r\n)\r\nexport const customTableB = customSchema.table('table_b',\r\n\t{id: uuid('id').primaryKey()}\r\n)\r\nexport const defaultTableA = pgTable('table_a',\r\n\t{id: uuid('id').primaryKey()}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill result in migrations for the following tables:\r\n```\r\ntable_a 1 columns 1 indexes 0 fks // in schema 'public'\r\ntable_b 1 columns 1 indexes 0 fks // in schema 'custom'\r\n```\r\nHowever there will be no migration created for `table_a` in schema 'custom'\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSchema definition should result in migrations for the following tables:\r\n```\r\ntable_a 1 columns 1 indexes 0 fks // in schema 'public'\r\ntable_a 1 columns 1 indexes 0 fks // in schema 'custom'\r\ntable_b

(On the first run it creates a SQL file that builds all my existing tables, and on subsequent runs it exits saying that no changes are required.)\r\n\r\n- Is my understanding correct?

Describe what you want\r\n\r\nCurrently, running `drizzle-kit introspect:{dialect}` command lets you pull DDL from an existing database and generate `schema.ts`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the generated `schema.ts` only contains the declaration for each table. \r\nExample:\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { pgTable, serial, text, integer, jsonb } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';\r\nimport { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';\r\n \r\nexport const users = pgTable('users', {\r\n\tid: serial('id').primaryKey(),\r\n\tname: text('name'),\r\n});\r\n \r\nexport const profileInfo = pgTable('profile_info', {\r\n\tid: serial('id').primaryKey(),\r\n\tuserId: integer(\"user_id\").references(() => users.id),\r\n\tmetadata: jsonb(\"metadata\"),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Missing the relation between users and profileInfo. \r\n// Even though drizzle generated the reference correctly.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if drizzle-kit could infer and generate the relations based on foreign key references. This approach is used by other frameworks\r\nhttps://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/introspection#relations\r\n\r\nThe generated `schema.ts` should look like this.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { pgTable, serial, text, integer, jsonb } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';\r\nimport { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';\r\n \r\nexport const users = pgTable('users', {\r\n\tid: serial('id').primaryKey(),\r\n\tname: text('name'),\r\n});\r\n  \r\nexport const profileInfo = pgTable('profile_info', {\r\n\tid: serial('id').primaryKey(),\r\n\tuserId: integer(\"user_id\").references(() => users.id),\r\n\tmetadata: jsonb(\"metadata\"),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Auto generated the relation\r\nexport const usersProfileInfoRelations = relations(users, ({ one }) => ({\r\n\tprofileInfo: one(profileInfo, {\r\n\t\tfields: [users.id],\r\n\t\treferences: [profileInfo.userId],\r\n\t}),\r\n}));\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/202/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/201","id":1915616621,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M5yLf1t","number":201,"title":"[BUG]: composite primary keys on planetscale are always recreated","user":{"login":"mlecoq","id":3649784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDk3ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3649784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq","html_url":"https://github.com/mlecoq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlecoq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-09-27T13:39:44Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T13:39:44Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"### What version of `drizzle-orm` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.28.6\r\n\r\n### What version of `drizzle-kit` are you using?\r\n\r\n0.19.13\r\n\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nI have a table with a composite primary on a planetscale database\r\n\r\n```\r\n CREATE TABLE `Follow` (\r\n    `followerId` char(24) NOT NULL,\r\n    `followingId` char(24) NOT NULL,\r\n    `createdAt` datetime(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(3),\r\n    PRIMARY KEY (`followerId`, `followingId`),\r\n    KEY `Follow_followingId_idx` (`followingId`),\r\n    KEY `Follow_followerId_idx` (`followerId`)\r\n) ENGINE InnoDB,\r\n  CHARSET utf8mb4,\r\n  COLLATE utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

guys, first of all, Drizzle is awesome.

We must convert the DDL script into a Typescript Drizzle Schema.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there are plans to introduce an ER design tool that is capable of exporting an ER diagram directly into a

Drizzle, however, lacks this essential feature, making it difficult to rollback database schema changes.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. **Initial Schema**: Assume we have a table `TODO` with fields `{id, title}`.\r\n2. **Add Field**: Add a new field `description` to the `TODO` table so that the schema becomes `{id, title, description}`.\r\n    - Generate a migration file and migrate changes to the database.\r\n3. **Attempt to Revert**: Now, let's say you want to revert these changes to `{id, title}`.\r\n    - Run `drizzle-kit drop` to choose which migration file to delete. Assume you remove the last generated file that adds the 'description' field.\r\n    - Run the application to try and revert the schema change. This fails to revert the database to `{id, title}`.\r\n\r\n#### Issues Encountered\r\n\r\n1. Drizzle doesn't offer an automatic way to revert migrations.\r\n2. After dropping the last migration file, generating a new migration file via `drizzle-kit generate:{dialect}` results in an empty file. This is because Drizzle checks the last migration file and the current schema, both of which are `{id, title}`, thus seeing no changes to migrate.\r\n\r\n#### Suggested Improvement\r\n\r\nImplement functionality similar to TypeORM’s `up()` and `down()` methods to facilitate easy migration rollbacks.\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nI would have contributed this feature myself, but unfortunately, Drizzle-kit doesn't seem to be open source.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/183/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182","id":1879137042,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M5wAVsS","number":182,"title":"Issues with PostgreSQL Migrations: Unexplained Column Existence Errors, Revert Challenges, and Supabase Dashboard","user":{"login":"wojtekKrol","id":64773541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzczNTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64773541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol","html_url":"https://github.com/wojtekKrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wojtekKrol/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-09-03T15:24:55Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T16:34:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"#### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen working with migrations in PostgreSQL using Drizzle Kit, I encounter a series of challenges. Most notably, I get console errors claiming that a column already exists, even after attempts to revert the changes. Additionally, none of these changes appear to be reflected in the Supabase dashboard.\r\n\r\n#### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an initial table definition using Drizzle Kit:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    export const todos = pgTable('todos', {\r\n      id: serial('id').primaryKey(),\r\n      title: varchar('title', { length: 256 }),\r\n      description: varchar('description', { length: 256 }),\r\n      isDone: boolean('isDone').default(false),\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n2. Run `yarn dev` to fire the migration on server startup.\r\n3. Add a new column to the table definition:\r\n\r\n    ```js\r\n    export const todos = pgTable('todos', {\r\n      // ... (previous columns),\r\n      isNotDone: boolean('isNotDone').default(false),\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n4. Run the migration again.\r\n5. Console error suggests that the column \"isNotDone\" already exists.\r\n6. Revert the table definition to its previous state and generate a new migration file.\r\n7. Run the migration script again.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect the migration to work smoothly without throwing errors about pre-existing columns when a new column is actually being added. \r\n**Additionally, reverting changes should be straightforward and reflected in the Supabase dashboard.**\r\n\r\n#### Error Messages / Logs\r\n\r\nHere are some of the console errors received:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPostgresError: column \"isNotDone\" of relation \"todos\" already exists\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoreover, each migration run logs the following notices:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"severity_local\": \"NOTICE\",\r\n  \"code\": \"42P06\",\r\n  \"message\": \"schema \\\"drizzle\\\" already exists, skipping\",\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Questions\r\n\r\n1. Is there a simpler way to revert changes to a table? \r\n2. Can `drizzle kit drop` be used to remove the last migration files and run the app again?\r\n3. Are the 'NOTICE' logs just informational or is there something I should address?\r\n4. Why are the changes not being reflected in the Supabase dashboard?\r\n\r\n#### Additional Context\r\n\r\nMy migration script is as follows:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/postgres-js/migrator';\r\nimport db from './db';\r\n\r\nexport const migrateDB = async () => {\r\n  console.log('migrating db');\r\n  await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: 'drizzle/migrations' });\r\n  console.log('db migrated');\r\n};\r\n\r\nmigrateDB();\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/181","id":1878827019,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M5v_KAL","number":181,"title":"Add a programatic JavaScript API","user":{"login":"kwangure","id":86817609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODE3NjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86817609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure","html_url":"https://github.com/kwangure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kwangure/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-09-02T20:03:17Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T19:20:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I'm currently working on a CMS.

the type string on `generate:pg`\r\n\r\n#### Example `schema.ts`\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { timestamp, uuid, customType, pgTable } from \"drizzle-orm/pg-core\";\r\n\r\nconst geometryCType = customType<\r\n    { \r\n        data: string,\r\n        config: { type: string; SRID: number }\r\n    }\r\n>({\r\n    dataType(config) {\r\n        return `geometry(${config?.type},${config?.SRID})`;\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport const locations = pgTable(\"locations\", {\r\n    id: uuid(\"id\").defaultRandom().notNull(),\r\n    geom: geometryCType(\"geom\", { type: \"POINT\", SRID: 4326 }),\r\n    createdAt: timestamp(\"created_at\")\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example output from `generate:pg`\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"locations\" (\r\n\t\"id\" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"geom\" \"geometry(POINT,4326)\",\r\n\t\"created_at\" timestamp\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How it should look\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"locations\" (\r\n\t\"id\" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() NOT NULL,\r\n\t\"geom\" geometry(POINT,4326),\r\n\t\"created_at\" timestamp\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Additional Info\r\n\r\nIf you create a custom type that returns a standard pg data type ie \"varchar\" from `dataType() {}` the \"\" are not there (as expected).\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nAfter `generate:pg` you can just modify the migration sql that was generated and remove the \"\", and it works, but this is obviously not ideal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/167/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/166","id":1865758013,"node_id":"I_kwDOHoY85M5vNTU9","number":166,"title":"Add

been trying to generate types from my existing postgres db, but have found a case where introspection doesn't work correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal reproduction:\r\n```sql\r\n\r\nCREATE TYPE

was wondering if it was possible for drizzle-kit to query the database when trying to push a new schema to check if the data inside is maybe already compatible.\n\nAs it is right now, drizzle-kit will just give you the option to wipe the whole table when you're for example lowering a varchar's length and try to push that schema.\n\nIt doesn't matter if all the data inside the database already conforms to the new schema, it'll still try to truncate the table. \n\nI'm sure doing this for every changed schema property would result in a lot of extra work, especially when there are multiple different databases that need to be supported. \n\nAdmittedly the way it works now isn't the end of the world since you can just dump the whole table beforehand and fill it up again but having
