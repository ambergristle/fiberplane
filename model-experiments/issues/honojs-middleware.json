have a feature request for a new Typia OpenAPI/Swagger generator middleware, similar to hono/zod-openapi. \r\nTypia is significantly faster than Zod for input validation, as demonstrated in this [benchmark](https://dev.to/samchon/typescript-json-is-10-1000x-times-faster-than-zod-and-io-ts-8n6).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Hono Typia middleware lacks an OpenAPI generator, which limits its practical usage. Integrating this feature would greatly enhance the ease of creating APIs with Typia and make Hono APIs even faster.\r\n\r\nTo aid in this integration, the following projects can be referenced:\r\n\r\n- Typia NestJS OpenAPI Generator:\r\n\r\n   [Typia NestJS OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/samchon/nestia/tree/db4ce37cc3e99b5920d9267a00cecfee495efe74/packages/sdk/src/generates)\r\n\r\n   This package has already implemented a similar functionality for NestJS.\r\n\r\n- Typia OpenAPI Converter:\r\n\r\n   [Typia OpenAPI Converter](https://github.com/samchon/openapi)\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic to see a similar feature added to Hono. This enhancement would streamline the development process and leverage Typia's speed for ultra-fast Hono APIs.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/554","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/554/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/554/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/554/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/554","id":2328835607,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5xLjk5","number":554,"title":"Version Packages","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-06-01T02:39:28Z","updated_at":"2024-06-01T02:40:08Z","closed_at":"2024-06-01T02:40:07Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/pulls/554","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/554","diff_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/554.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/554.patch","merged_at":"2024-06-01T02:40:07Z"},"body":"This PR was opened by the [Changesets release](https://github.com/changesets/action) GitHub action.

This means that each API was able to perform consecutive validations on the second and third arguments, but from 0.31.0 validations will be performed using an independent pipe

The middleware fails to work in this setup, but functions correctly when set using the `app.use()` syntax.\r\n\r\n## Issue Details\r\n\r\n### Non-Working Setup\r\nWhen I configure the `cors` middleware within the route definition, the middleware does not seem to function as expected. Here's the relevant code snippet:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport const app = OpenAPIHono();\r\n\r\nconst corsMiddleware = cors({\r\n  origin: [\"*\"],\r\n  allowHeaders: ['*'],\r\n  allowMethods: ['POST', 'OPTIONS'],\r\n  exposeHeaders: ['Content-Length', 'X-Kuma-Revision'],\r\n  maxAge: 600,\r\n  credentials: true,\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.openAPIRegistry.registerComponent(\"securitySchemes\", \"Bearer\", {\r\n  type: \"http\",\r\n  scheme: \"bearer\",\r\n  in: \"header\",\r\n  description: \"Bearer token\"\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst route = createRoute({\r\n  path: \"/\",\r\n  method: \"post\",\r\n  description: \"test\",\r\n  middleware: [corsMiddleware, verifyFirebaseAuth(config)],\r\n  security: [{ Bearer: [] }],\r\n  responses: {\r\n    200: {\r\n      description: \"success\",\r\n      content: {\r\n        \"application/json\": {\r\n          schema: z.object({\r\n            message: z.string(),\r\n          })\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    401: {\r\n      description: \"Unauthorized\",\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.openapi(route, \r\n //...\r\n ```\r\n \r\n \r\n### Working Setup\r\nHowever, when I apply the cors middleware using app.use(), it functions as expected. Here is the working configuration:\r\n ```typescript\r\n export const app = OpenAPIHono();\r\n\r\nconst corsMiddleware = cors({\r\n  origin: [\"*\"],\r\n  allowHeaders: ['*'],\r\n  allowMethods: ['POST', 'OPTIONS'],\r\n  exposeHeaders: ['Content-Length', 'X-Kuma-Revision'],\r\n  maxAge: 600,\r\n  credentials: true,\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.use(corsMiddleware);\r\n\r\napp.openAPIRegistry.registerComponent(\"securitySchemes\", \"Bearer\", {\r\n  type: \"http\",\r\n  scheme: \"bearer\",\r\n  in: \"header\",\r\n  description: \"Bearer token\"\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst route = createRoute({\r\n  path: \"/\",\r\n  method: \"post\",\r\n  description: \"test\",\r\n  middleware: [verifyFirebaseAuth(config)],\r\n  security: [{ Bearer: [] }],\r\n  responses: {\r\n    200: {\r\n      description: \"success\",\r\n      content: {\r\n        \"application/json\": {\r\n          schema: z.object({\r\n            message: z.string(),\r\n          })\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    401: {\r\n      description: \"Unauthorized\",\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.openapi(route, \r\n //...\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n- hono: 4.3.8\r\n- @hono/zod-openapi: 0.12.2\r\n\r\nAny insights or fixes for this behavior would be greatly appreciated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/530","id":2304147400,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5v3YnZ","number":530,"title":"Version Packages","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-05-18T16:00:16Z","updated_at":"2024-05-18T16:01:26Z","closed_at":"2024-05-18T16:01:26Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/pulls/530","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/530","diff_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/530.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/530.patch","merged_at":"2024-05-18T16:01:26Z"},"body":"This PR was opened by the [Changesets release](https://github.com/changesets/action) GitHub action.

Description:\r\n\r\nWhen using `vValidator` to validate a query, if the valibot schema includes a number type, the type inference for an RPC route fails.\r\n\r\n### Code to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { vValidator } from \"@hono/valibot-validator\";\r\nimport { zValidator } from \"@hono/zod-validator\";\r\nimport { hc } from \"hono/client\";\r\nimport { Hono } from

page: z.coerce.number().int(),\r\n      perPage: z.coerce.number().int(),\r\n    })\r\n  ),\r\n  (c) => c.json({ withZod: true })\r\n);\r\n\r\ntype RouteWithZod = typeof routeWithZod;\r\n\r\nconst routeWithValibot = new Hono().get(\r\n  \"/valibot\",\r\n  vValidator(\r\n    \"query\",\r\n    v.object({\r\n      page: v.coerce(v.number([v.integer()]), Number),\r\n      perPage: v.coerce(v.number([v.integer()]), Number),\r\n    })\r\n  ),\r\n  (c) => c.json({ withValibot: true })\r\n);\r\n\r\ntype RouteWithValibot = typeof routeWithValibot;\r\n\r\n// inferred route type successfully\r\nconst clientWithZod = hc<RouteWithZod>(\"/\");\r\n\r\n// failed to infer route type\r\nconst clientWithValibot = hc<RouteWithValibot>(\"/\");\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Type Inference:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst clientWithValibot: {\r\n    [x: string]: ClientRequest<{\r\n        [Method: `$${Lowercase<string>}`]: {\r\n            input: Partial<ValidationTargets> & {\r\n                param?: Record<string, string> | undefined;\r\n            };\r\n            output: any;\r\n        };\r\n    }>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Type Inference:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst clientWithValibot: {\r\n    valibot: ClientRequest<{\r\n        $get: {\r\n            input: {\r\n                query: {\r\n                    page: string | string[];\r\n                    perPage: string | string[];\r\n                };\r\n            };\r\n            output: {\r\n                withValibot: boolean;\r\n            };\r\n        };\r\n    }>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nzod-validator correctly infers the type.

believe there was a similar issue with `@hono/zod-openapi`: https://github.com/honojs/middleware/issues/436. Linking some related work in [`asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi`](https://github.com/asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi/commit/732f52b4cbc3f7d0df661626bfed394e5faaee42#diff-47407fecafdf5f5cd55403c3de457833ddf9b6fab45253c04e1dc4c7cb4495b1)\r\n\r\nFor `@hono/sentry` and I think `toucan-js` already supports ESM[^1], so this might be an easy fix?

After processing signIn and authHandler, the middleware overwrites the authjs.callback-url cookie for the default callback url. So even if I call `setCookie` to overwrite the cookie, it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nFor sure, The Client useSession works like the official document(readme). \r\n```typescript\r\nimport { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'\r\n\r\nexport const useSession = () => {\r\n  const { data, status } = useQuery({\r\n    queryKey: ['session'],\r\n    queryFn: async () => {\r\n      const res = await fetch('/api/auth/session')\r\n      // console.log('useSession res: ', res)\r\n\r\n      return res.json()\r\n    },\r\n    staleTime: 5 * (60 * 1000),\r\n    gcTime: 10 * (60 * 1000),\r\n    refetchOnWindowFocus: true\r\n  })\r\n  return { session: data, status }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```typescript\r\n'use client'\r\nimport { useSession } from '@/hooks/use-session'\r\nexport default function page() {\r\n  const { status, session } = useSession()\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, I'd like to get an auth session from a server component in NextJS. So, I created a hook for this purpose.\r\n``` typescript\r\nexport async function checkServerSession() {\r\n  const fetchUrl = process.env.BASE_URL + '/api/auth/session'\r\n  // console.log(\"fetchUrl: \", fetchUrl)\r\n  const res = await fetch(fetchUrl)\r\n  const result = await res.json() \r\n  console.log('checkServerSession res: ', result)\r\n\r\n  return result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport 'server-only'\r\nimport { checkServerSession } from '@/hooks/checkServerSession'\r\nimport { redirect } from 'next/navigation'\r\n\r\nasync function layout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\r\n  const session = await checkServerSession()\r\n  \r\n\r\n  if (!session) {\r\n    console.log(\"No Session Found\")\r\n    redirect('/signin?callbackUrl=/finance')\r\n  } else {\r\n    console.log('Session Found: ', session)\r\n  }\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\n \r\n  However, The session is always Null although I have've signed-in and had an auth session after github(provider) login. \r\n  I need get a session in server components not client components because of a special purpose(to check the auth status in the server more securely without evaluating a client page component. )\r\n Next-Auth library has a getServerSession() but it seems that hono auth.js middleware  doesn't have such a thing. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  ```typescript\r\nsignIn('GitHub', { redirect: false, callbackUrl: searchParams.get('callbackUrl') || '/' })\r\n```\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  ```typescript\r\nconst app = new Hono()\r\napp.use(logger(customLogger))\r\n\r\napp.use(\r\n  '*',\r\n  cors({\r\n    origin: (origin) => origin,\r\n    allowHeaders: ['Content-Type'],\r\n    allowMethods: ['*'],\r\n    maxAge: 86400,\r\n    credentials: true\r\n  })\r\n)\r\n\r\napp.use('*', initAuthConfig(getAuthConfig))\r\nconst authMiddleware = async (c: Context, next: Next) => {\r\n  console.log('👍Hono authMiddleware!')\r\n  // console.log(\"Context: \", c)\r\n  await next()\r\n}\r\nconst setCookieMiddleware = async (c: Context, next: Next) => {\r\n  console.log('👍Hono setCookieMiddleware!')\r\n  setCookie(c, 'authjs.callback-url', 'http://localhost:3000/finance')\r\n  await next()\r\n}\r\napp.use('/api/auth/*', authMiddleware, setCookieMiddleware, authHandler())\r\n```\r\n  \r\nAny idea would be helpful 👍\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/483/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/482","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/482/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/482/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/482","id":2267379252,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5t7QBZ","number":482,"title":"fix(trpc-server): Support asynchronous context creation","user":{"login":"jikyu","id":4361648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNjE2NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4361648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu","html_url":"https://github.com/jikyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jikyu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-04-28T06:34:44Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T04:04:45Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T04:04:45Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/pulls/482","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/482","diff_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/482.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/482.patch","merged_at":"2024-04-29T04:04:45Z"},"body":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/458 broke ability to create trpc contexts asynchronously (see attached screenshot).

A separate fix would be needed to support Groups that change base _or_ documentation would need to explain that nested app instances must be [Grouped without changing

There are 22 releases between the installed (0.13.1) and the latest (0.30.0) versions.\r\n\r\nThis is because peer deps are declared with a caret notation and `^0.13.1` doesn't match 0.14.0 and later.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/honojs/middleware/blob/c56b22f15ad9203d46b15440bd7764e45d244b99/packages/valibot-validator/package.json#L29-L32\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic when a middleware is installed in a project where its peer deps are already used.

love working with hono/zod-openapi and hono in general. We do have a challenge with configuring route-specific middleware in a way that is both maintainable, readable and secure (the last argument being that you make it very difficult for developer to simply forget making an api route secure enough).\r\n\r\nOur goal was to support per route a different combination of middleware. such as, but not limited to:\r\n- rate limiting with varying config\r\n-  guard middleware with varying protection levels. For example just check authentication, check tenant (for high-sec multi-tenant systems), system admin level check with fixed ip requirement etcetera. Or simply a route that allows public access.\r\n- The guard level needs to be made explicitly on each route: public, auth, tenant or system level. This way its pretty difficult to forget about it?\r\n\r\nYou can already create route-specific middleware but you get sort of a duplication of your entire route configuration - if you also use zod-openapi?\r\n\r\nOur conclusion was to implement it in the createRoute step, but because this is not supported by `hono/zod-openapi`, we now created an abstraction layer that resolves into createRoute. See an example below and the complete work here: https://github.com/cellajs/cella/blob/a51e182662cbcd3db8575dec4356c78203129013/backend/src/types/common.ts.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nguard: RouteConfig['guard'];\r\nmiddlewares: RouteConfig['middlewares'];\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur question is if this solution of ours could also be beneficial to others that use hono/zod-openapi and developer using  hono in general. It could improve the flexibility of setting middleware like also superficially discussed in this Twitter thread? https://twitter.com/jullerino/status/1763525247477641688\r\n\r\nOr perhaps there are other ways to achieve the same

advance, sorry if my issue is not appropriate, either because it is a duplicate (not seen any), or if I have miss something, I'm an aspiring web developer and quite new to that world._\r\n\r\nI'm actually using @hono/typebox-validator and I've found that in the case of param validation, I cannot type the params with something else than string, which is understandable, like explained in the issue #91 by @yusukebe\r\n\r\nI've seen that with zod, transform types will automatically convert values after the validation, while with Typebox, you need to use \"Value.Decode()\" after the check to get the transformed data, so it would be cool to have it doing that by default, as follow;\r\n\r\nFrom\r\n```typescript\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nreturn validator(target, (data, c) => {\r\n    if (Value.Check(schema, data)) {\r\n      if (hook) {\r\n        const hookResult = hook({ success: true, data }, c)\r\n        if (hookResult instanceof Response || hookResult instanceof Promise) {\r\n          return hookResult\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return data\r\n    }\r\n    return c.json({ success: false, errors: [...Value.Errors(schema, data)] }, 400)\r\n  })\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo\r\n```typescript\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nreturn validator(target, (data, c) => {\r\n    if (Value.Check(schema, data)) {\r\n      if (hook) {\r\n        const hookResult = hook({ success: true, data: Value.Decode(schema, data) }, c)\r\n        if (hookResult instanceof Response || hookResult instanceof Promise) {\r\n          return hookResult\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      return Value.Decode(schema, data)\r\n    }\r\n    return c.json({ success: false, errors: [...Value.Errors(schema, data)] }, 400)\r\n  })\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe even another dedicated function specifically for case you use Transform values ?\r\n\r\nWhich means that now we would get back decoded values;\r\n```typescript\r\nconst schema = Type.Object({\r\n  id: Type.Transform(Type.String())\r\n    .Decode(value => Number(value))\r\n    .Encode(value => String(value));\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get(\r\n  '/users/:id',\r\n  tbValidator('param', schema),\r\n  c => {\r\n    const params = c.req.valid('param'); // The id is a number there\r\n   \r\n    // ... do something\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe the behavior is expected to be that way and I have missed something ? If not, I want to create a pull request for that, would it be ok ?

trying to use custom middleware with `@hono/zod-openapi` to enhance request handling by inserting custom logic and types. However, it seems like the current setup does not allow middleware to be inserted in a way that the types are extended or accessible within the handler that follows.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior \r\n\r\nUsing Hono normally, I can insert middleware and extend types as follows:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const middleware = createMiddleware<{\r\n  Variables: {\r\n    userId: string;\r\n  };\r\n}>(async (c, next) => {\r\n  const userId = await getUserId();\r\n  c.set(\"userId\", userId);\r\n  await next();\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get(\"/me\", middleware, async (c) => {\r\n  const userId = c.var.userId\r\n  const user = await someORM.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });\r\n  return c.json(user);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n## Desired Behavior with @hono/zod-openapi\r\n\r\nI would like to achieve a similar pattern with @hono/zod-openapi, but it's unclear how to properly insert middleware that extends the context or request types.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const app = new OpenAPIHono().openapi(\r\n  createRoute({\r\n    method: \"get\",\r\n    path: \"/me\",\r\n    responses: {\r\n      200: {\r\n        description: \"OK\",\r\n        content: {\r\n

Attempting to use middleware here\r\n  async (c) => {\r\n    return c.json({ name: \"hello world\" });\r\n  },\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a recommended way to insert custom middleware with @hono/zod-openapi that allows for extending types or injecting custom logic into the request handling

Hono/Zod-OpenAPI Team,\r\n\r\nI'm encountering an issue with Swagger integration in a route I defined using Hono/Zod-OpenAPI. Specifically, I'm unable to send the \"Authorization\" header through Swagger's interface. Here's a brief overview of the problem:\r\n\r\n**Issue Description:**\r\n\r\n    I've defined a route in my Hono application and used Zod-OpenAPI to generate the Swagger documentation.\r\n    When I try to send a request with an \"Authorization\" header through Swagger UI, it seems like the header is not included in the request.\r\n    This issue is preventing me from testing secured endpoints directly from the Swagger UI.\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\r\n\r\n    Define a route in Hono using Zod-OpenAPI.\r\n    Add an \"Authorization\" header requirement in the OpenAPI specification.\r\n    Attempt to send a request with the \"Authorization\" header through Swagger UI.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n\r\n    The \"Authorization\" header should be included in the request, and the endpoint should recognize and validate it.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\n\r\n    The \"Authorization\" header appears to be missing or not sent in the request made from Swagger UI.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n    Hono version: ^3.12.8\r\n    Zod-OpenAPI version: ^0.9.6\r\n    Node.js version: v20.8.1\r\n    \r\nFor your reference, here is the link to the relevant part of my code in my GitHub repository: [My Project Code](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/hono-todo/blob/main/src/modules/users/routes/userUpdateByIdRoute.ts). \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this issue. Is this a known problem, or am I missing something in my configuration? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and assistance.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1876\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 12 20 26\"

A better alternative would be creating my own custom class which wraps `OpenAPIHono` and always injects the `defaultHook`, but before I do that I wanted to ask whether the current behavior is intentional or maybe a bug?\r\n\r\nThank you for creating Hono and any hints which might help me solve the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/322","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/322/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/322/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/322/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/322","id":2049529059,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5iaqsW","number":322,"title":"Version Packages","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-12-19T22:24:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-28T19:44:38Z","closed_at":"2023-12-28T19:44:38Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/pulls/322","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/322","diff_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/322.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/322.patch","merged_at":"2023-12-28T19:44:38Z"},"body":"This PR was opened by the [Changesets release](https://github.com/changesets/action) GitHub action.

See pics:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-09 14-39-39](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/3282661/dedc5e07-5e75-4ff4-8d73-eba0a2e6bdd5)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-12-09 14-39-49](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/3282661/0210f9d5-eedb-42c9-89f4-45eec10c86cb)\r\n\r\n\r\nI also tried using the Headers Schema:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst HeadersSchema = z.object({\r\n  // Header keys must be in lowercase, `Authorization` is not allowed.\r\n  authorization: z.string().openapi({\r\n    example: \"Bearer SECRET\",\r\n  })\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut got this error:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"success\": false,\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"issues\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"code\": \"invalid_type\",\r\n        \"expected\": \"string\",\r\n        \"received\": \"undefined\",\r\n        \"path\": [\r\n          \"authorization\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"message\": \"Required\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"name\": \"ZodError\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelevant Code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { OpenAPIHono, createRoute, z } from \"@hono/zod-openapi\";\r\nimport { swaggerUI } from \"@hono/swagger-ui\";\r\nimport { bearerAuth } from \"hono/bearer-auth\";\r\n\r\nconst app = new OpenAPIHono();\r\n\r\nconst token = \"honoiscool\";\r\n\r\napp.use(\"/api/*\", bearerAuth({ token }));\r\n\r\napp.openAPIRegistry.registerComponent(\"securitySchemes\", \"\", {\r\n  type: \"http\",\r\n  name: \"Authorization\",\r\n  scheme: \"bearer\",\r\n  in: \"header\",\r\n  description: \"Bearer token\",\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.openapi(\r\n  {\r\n    method: \"get\",\r\n    path: \"/api/page\",\r\n    operationId: \"page\",\r\n    security: [\r\n      {\r\n        bearerAuth: [], // also tried 'Bearer'\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n    responses: {\r\n      200: {\r\n        description: \"Respond to a message\",\r\n        content: {\r\n          \"application/json\": {\r\n            schema: z.object({\r\n              message: z.string(),\r\n            }),\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      401: {\r\n        description: \"no token\",\r\n        content: {\r\n          \"application/json\": {\r\n            schema: z.object({\r\n              message: z.string(),\r\n            }),\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  (c) => {\r\n    return c.jsonT({\r\n      message: \"hello, the time is: \" + new Date().toISOString(),\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n  (result, c) => {\r\n    console.log(result);\r\n    // console.log(c);\r\n    if (!result.success) {\r\n      return c.jsonT(\r\n        {\r\n          code: 400,\r\n          message: \"Validation Error\",\r\n        },\r\n        400\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n\r\napp.get('/api/page', (c) => {\r\n  return c.json({ message: 'You are authorized' })\r\n})\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt almost seems to avoid the 401 spec, and skip the error hook too.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great. I'm really at a loss here on how to address this.

This validator actually works if you run it and is used to accept both snake_case & camelCase and transform the keys into camelCase for validation\r\n\r\nWithout the transform it will construct the correct openapi schema in the spec:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst bodySchema = z.strictObject({\r\n    fieldId: z.string().nullish().openapi({\r\n        description: \"Test Field ID\",\r\n    }),\r\n    errorType: z.string().openapi({\r\n        description: \"Error Type\",\r\n    }),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"requestBody\": {\r\n    \"content\": {\r\n      \"application/json\": {\r\n        \"schema\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"object\",\r\n          \"properties\": {\r\n            \"fieldId\": {\r\n              \"type\": \"string\",\r\n

I'm assuming the context of the actual object is lost when using transform or something related to that.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/238","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/238/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/238/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/238/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/issues/238","id":1978810244,"node_id":"I_kwDOIOtRMc518j-E","number":238,"title":"TypeBox

team,\r\nI encountered this issue when trying to build an API with more than one input type (e.g. PATH + QUERY like `/{path}?q=xxx`).\r\n\r\nWhen using `zod-openapi` with a route including `query` input data with (or without) `params`, the type resolution fails when trying to access the input from the handler.\r\n\r\nIn this context (the sample file is provided at the end of this post)\r\n```ts\r\napp.openapi(route, async (c) => {\r\n    const { paramValue } = c.req.valid('param') as ParamSchema;\r\n    const { queryValue } = c.req.valid('query') as QuerySchema;\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\nthe calls to `c.req.valid` will produce the following errors at compile time:\r\n```bash\r\nsrc/min.ts:43:40 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.                                                 \r\n\r\n43     const { paramValue } = c.req.valid('param') as ParamSchema;\r\n

\r\n\r\n\r\nFound 2 errors in the same file, starting at: src/min.ts:43\r\n```\r\nthat is the output of `bun run tsc --noEmit --pretty --skipLibCheck --strict src/min.ts`\r\n\r\nNote that the problem disappears if we just use the `param` as input:\r\n```ts\r\nconst route = createRoute({\r\n    method: 'get',\r\n    path: '/{paramValue}/path',\r\n    request: {\r\n        params: ParamSchema,\r\n        // query: QuerySchema,\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.openapi(route, async (c) => {\r\n    const { paramValue } = c.req.valid('param') as ParamSchema; // Works !\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut not when commenting out the `param` and leaving just the query:\r\n```ts\r\nconst route = createRoute({\r\n    method: 'get',\r\n    path: '/path', // Note the {param} is removed from the path\r\n    request: {\r\n        //params: ParamSchema,\r\n        query: QuerySchema,\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst app = new OpenAPIHono();\r\n\r\napp.openapi(route, async (c) => {\r\n    // error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.\r\n    const { queryValue } = c.req.valid('query') as QuerySchema;\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n## Build traces\r\n\r\nLooking at the build traces from `tsc`, we can see for `param` the display type is correct `<T extends \\\"param\\\">(target: T) ...` allowing to proceed without any errors.\r\n\r\n**Param only**\r\n```json\r\n{\"id\":15461,\"symbolName\":\"valid\",\"recursionId\":3796,\"firstDeclaration\":{\"path\":\"/home/user/Documents/substreams-clock-api/node_modules/hono/dist/types/request.d.ts\",\"start\":{\"line\":57,\"character\":71},\"end\":{\"line\":58,\"character\":94}},\"flags\":[\"Object\"],\"display\":\"<T extends \\\"param\\\">(target: T) => InputToDataByTarget<{ param: { paramValue: \\\"a\\\" | \\\"b\\\" | \\\"c\\\"; }; }, T>\"},\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever in the other cases, it resolves to `<T extends never>(target: T) ...` making it impossible to infer the type.\r\n\r\n***Query only***\r\n```json\r\n{\"id\":15453,\"symbolName\":\"valid\",\"recursionId\":3793,\"firstDeclaration\":{\"path\":\"/home/user/Documents/substreams-clock-api/node_modules/hono/dist/types/request.d.ts\",\"start\":{\"line\":57,\"character\":71},\"end\":{\"line\":58,\"character\":94}},\"flags\":[\"Object\"],\"display\":\"<T

unknown; }>, T>\"},\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Both**\r\n```json\r\n{\"id\":15472,\"symbolName\":\"valid\",\"recursionId\":3803,\"firstDeclaration\":{\"path\":\"/home/user/Documents/substreams-clock-api/node_modules/hono/dist/types/request.d.ts\",\"start\":{\"line\":57,\"character\":71},\"end\":{\"line\":58,\"character\":94}},\"flags\":[\"Object\"],\"display\":\"<T

I initially started with plain REST, but then moved on to using GraphQL using the middleware you provide. [Pothos](https://github.com/hayes/pothos) is a type safe GraphQL schema builder which I'd really like to use together with Hono, but I'm having some issues trying to get them to work together. \r\n1. Context Propagation\r\nI can get the context from the pipeline to go to a root resolver, but not to go to individual resolvers, e.g. for mutations.\r\n2. When I try to use `authScopes` for resolvers, the GraphQL processing returns this error: \"Invalid value used as weak map key\". I raised an issue in the Pothos repo here: https://github.com/hayes/pothos/issues/1064, and the author thinks it's related to propagating the context object, so if 1 is solved, then this should be solved also.\r\n3.  It would be nice to opt out of the GraphQL error handling, e.g. by returning a plain old 401 http code, but everything gets wrapped in a GraphQL error. Not sure if there's anything that can be done about this.\r\n\r\nI'm using Cloudflare Workers and it's not trivial to get everything up and running, so I have created a full repro of these issues, along with tests that demonstrate them at this repo: https://github.com/armstrong-pv/hono-pothos-issue-repro\r\n\r\nThere is a readme which covers setting everything up and running the tests: https://github.com/armstrong-pv/hono-pothos-issue-repro/blob/main/README.md.\r\nIt's pretty straightforward:\r\n````\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run tests\r\n````\r\nIf you want to run in dev mode:\r\n````\r\nnpm run dev\r\n````\r\n\r\nMany

Consider the following code:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst app = new OpenAPIHono().openapi(\r\n  createRoute({\r\n    summary: 'Test route',\r\n    method: 'post',\r\n    path: '/test',\r\n    responses: {\r\n      200: {\r\n        description: 'test',\r\n        content: {\r\n          'application/json': {\r\n            schema: z\r\n              .object({\r\n                name: z.string(),\r\n              })\r\n              .strict(), // <= a supposedly strict schema for { name: string; }\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  }),\r\n  (c) => {\r\n    return c.jsonT({\r\n      name: 'John Doe',\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that `zod-openapi` doesn't do a type parse/validation on return type. The following handler which returns an extra property/key also works, and doesn't throw an error:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n(c) => {\r\n  return c.jsonT({\r\n    name: 'John Doe',\r\n+    age: 12,\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could make the API less safe/secure. For example after fetching user data from a DB table, the developer could accidentally return the user data without omitting the password fields first, because TypeScript doesn't complain about the extra \"password\" field.\r\n\r\nI think this is related to the usage of `z.infer` in the `OutputType<R>` type, which I guess can be fixed by either:\r\n\r\n- raising a runtime error (i.e. invoking a `z.parse()` on the response) (using an extra middleware?)\r\n- or using advanced TypeScript typechecking tricks\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround for making sure the type is exactly the same? Or is there something I'm missing?

works!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/180","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/180/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/180/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/180/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/issues/180","id":1913705086,"node_id":"I_kwDOIOtRMc5yENJ-","number":180,"title":"[question]

@yusukebe.\r\nI've implemented the SwaggerUI middleware you mentioned the other day.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a suggestion, but for integration with zod-openapi,\r\n\r\nadding this to `@hono/zod-openapi`\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nexport class OpenAPIHono<\r\n  E extends Env = Env,\r\n  S extends Schema = {},\r\n  BasePath extends string = '/'\r\n > extends Hono<E, S, BasePath> {\r\n  openAPIRegistry: OpenAPIRegistry\r\n+ docPath?: string\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n  doc = (path: string, config: OpenAPIObjectConfig) => {\r\n+   this.docPath = path\r\n    this.get(path, (c) => {\r\n      const document = this.getOpenAPIDocument(config)\r\n      return c.json(document)\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand adding this to `@hono/swagger-ui`\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport function swaggerUIWithOpenAPIHono<\r\n  E extends Env = Env,\r\n  S extends Schema = {},\r\n  BasePath extends string = '/'\r\n>(path: string, app: OpenAPIHono<E, S, BasePath>, options: Omit<SwaggerUIOptions, 'docPath'> = {}) {\r\n  if (app.docPath === undefined) {\r\n    throw new Error('swaggerUIWithOpenAPIHono requires app.docPath to be set')\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  app.use(path, swaggerUI({ docPath: app.docPath, ...options }))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat so we can use this middleware without `docPath` setting like this.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\napp.doc('/custom/path.json', {\r\n  openapi: '3.0.0',\r\n  info: {\r\n    version: '1.0.0',\r\n    title: 'My API',\r\n  },\r\n  tags: [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'language',\r\n      description: 'en',\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n})\r\n\r\nswaggerUIWithOpenAPIHono('/docs', app)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may not be a good solution as it would encroach on @zod/hono-openapi. If you have any ideas, please let me know!\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/170","id":1909901514,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5bCuBm","number":170,"title":"feat(zod-openapi):

been playing with Hono (with Node) for a few days at work and we've seen some good performance from it.\r\n\r\nAfter testing `zod-to-openapi` I realized that we could add an additional route with the extension `.yml` to output the specs as YAML when needed.\r\n\r\ne.g.: The example below generates both `/docs` and `/docs.yml` routes\r\n```ts\r\nconst app = new OpenAPIHono()\r\napp.doc('/docs', swaggerOptions)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\nThe scenario would be using it with an Online [Swagger Editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/) or simply connecting to your editor of choice.\r\n\r\nFor performance reasons, it only parses it when the route is triggered:\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n```ts\r\nhandler.openapi(routeSchama, async (c) => {\r\n  const YAML = await import('js-yaml');\r\n  const result = YAML.dump(json)\r\n  \r\n  return c.text(result)\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, YAML parsing could be a new Hono helper such as `hono/html` if it becomes useful for more

So this is how I have it set up now:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// user.route.ts\r\napp.post('/', zValidator('json', ...zodSchema), userLogInController); // Typescript not complaining\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// user.controller.ts\r\nexport function userLogInController(c: Context) {\r\n  const { email, password } = c.req.valid('json'); // [TS error]: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.  \r\n  return c.text('Test');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a built in generic type that you can use to extend the Context type or Input type with my zod schema types.\r\n\r\nFor now I wrote my own generic type for this use case:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// utils/zod.ts\r\nexport type ZodContext<\r\n  Target extends keyof ValidationTargets,\r\n  Schema extends ZodType<any, any>\r\n> = Context<\r\n  Env,\r\n  string,\r\n  {\r\n    in: {\r\n      [key in Target]: z.infer<Schema>;\r\n    };\r\n    out: {\r\n      [key in Target]: z.infer<Schema>;\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// user.schema.ts\r\nconst userLogInZodSchema = z.object({\r\n  email: z.string().email(),\r\n  password: z.string(),\r\n});\r\nexport const userLogInSchema = zValidator('json', userLogInZodSchema);\r\nexport type UserLogInContext = ZodContext<'json', typeof userLogInZodSchema>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// user.route.ts\r\napp.post('/log-in', userLogInSchema, userLogInController);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// user.controller.ts\r\nexport async function userLogInController(c: UserLogInContext) {\r\n  const { email, password } = c.req.valid('json'); // No type errors anymore!\r\n  return c.text('It works!');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if something like this would be built in to @hono/zod-validator.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/154/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/153","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/153/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/153/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/153/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/153","id":1888820755,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5Z7-Xt","number":153,"title":"[zod-openapi] Merge subapps' definitions into main app","user":{"login":"mikestopcontinues","id":150434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDQzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues","html_url":"https://github.com/mikestopcontinues","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikestopcontinues/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-09-09T17:26:32Z","updated_at":"2023-09-11T23:25:42Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T23:25:41Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/pulls/153","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/153","diff_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/153.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/153.patch","merged_at":"2023-09-11T23:25:41Z"},"body":"Three features are included in this PR:\r\n\r\n1.

Issue Description:\r\n\r\n![unnamed](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/117732586/1710db99-2c7d-4a43-8ea3-30c86cb7755a)\r\n\r\nWhen following the example provided by @hono/zod-openapi and using the path parameter syntax '{id}' in Swagger to define an endpoint path like '/users/{id}', an issue arises where the defined endpoint cannot be found. This results in a 404 error when testing the endpoint with Postman or any. However, when the path is manually changed to '/users/:id', the endpoint functions correctly.\r\n\r\n# Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\nUtilize the example provided by @hono/zod-openapi for defining an endpoint path with a path parameter using '{id}' syntax.\r\nTry to access the defined endpoint using Postman or any other API testing tool.\r\n\r\n# Expected Behavior:\r\nThe endpoint defined with the '{id}' syntax should be successfully recognized and accessible both in Swagger documentation and when tested.\r\n\r\n# Actual Behavior:\r\nWhen using the defined '{id}' path parameter syntax in Swagger, the endpoint cannot be found, and a 404 error is returned when testing the endpoint api call. However, changing the path parameter syntax to '/users/:id' makes the endpoint work as expected.\r\n\r\n# Additional Information:\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be specific to the use of the '{id}' path parameter syntax in Swagger, as manually changing it to '/users/:id' in both the Swagger documentation and the testing tool resolves the issue.\r\nWhen modifying the OpenAPI documentation directly to use '/users/{id}' and accessing the endpoint, it functions correctly.\r\nIt appears that the inconsistency lies in how the '{id}' syntax is interpreted when used within the Swagger documentation.\r\n\r\n# Environment Details:\r\n\r\nLibrary: @hono/zod-openapi\r\nOpenAPI Definition: (Provide the relevant OpenAPI definition excerpt where the endpoint is defined)\r\nTesting Tool: Postman (or specify the testing tool used)\r\nAPI Endpoint Path: '/users/{id}'\r\nHTTP Method: GET (or specify the method)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots when i use :id in postman and swagger  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-25 14-30-29](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/117732586/60d10d31-97c9-4856-821a-9138a04ab016)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-25 14-32-52](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/117732586/17766d93-d02f-40c1-97ac-90dae45b9ef8)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots when i use {id} in postman and swagger \r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-25 14-32-11](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/117732586/092b4f4b-748c-48bb-8139-cef5b344ab89)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-25 14-34-48](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/117732586/e137d746-f4d1-4162-9b0e-26ff0093f7a4)\r\n\r\n# Labels:\r\n\r\nBug\r\nSwagger\r\nOpenAPI\r\nPath Parameter\r\nYour prompt attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated.

To provide more flexibility, the requirement has been changed to Hono v3.1.5 or higher.\r\n\r\nI've also done some minor refactoring inspired by the implementation in [qwik-city's middleware](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/09e55521deb9cab5e954b7cbf55b3e26d49de799/packages/qwik-city/middleware/cloudflare-pages/index.ts). \r\n\r\nNote: The newly introduced `getClientConn` function may need to address use cases where the implementation varies depending on the deployment environment, such as whether it's running on Cloudflare Workers or Deno. This middleware doesn't currently address these scenarios, I think it may require some additional planning and consideration.\r\n\r\nThank you for developing this wonderful software; I'm looking forward to contributing more in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/126","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/126/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/126/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/126/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/pull/126","id":1857611637,"node_id":"PR_kwDOIOtRMc5YS_g-","number":126,"title":"fix(zod-openapi)

I love it and can't ever go back to other frameworks.\r\n\r\nIn the past, I have included the [Server-Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Server-Timing) everywhere I could. It helps me a lot, especially in production systems, to be able to keep track of individual durations.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use this functionality in hono, I wrote the [middleware and functions](https://github.com/PassiDel/hono-timing) for it. Now I wanted to ask if it is wanted to add this to the third-party or even to core.\r\n\r\nThe usage looks something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { serve } from '@hono/node-server';\r\nimport { Hono } from 'hono';\r\nimport { endTime, setMetric, startTime, timing } from \"@puazzi/hono-timing\";\r\n\r\nconst app = new Hono();\r\n\r\n// add the middleware to your router\r\napp.use('*', timing());\r\n\r\napp.get('/', async (c) => {\r\n\r\n  // add custom metrics\r\n  setMetric(c, 'region', 'europe-west3')\r\n\r\n  // add custom metrics with timing, must be in milliseconds\r\n  setMetric(c, 'custom', 23.8, 'My custom Metric')\r\n\r\n  // start a new timer\r\n  startTime(c, 'db');\r\n  const data = await db.findMany(...);\r\n\r\n  // end the timer\r\n  endTime(c, 'db');\r\n\r\n  return c.json({ response: data });\r\n});\r\n\r\nserve(app);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/assets/22080311/fec047ee-f1f3-43b2-be41-af33449209a2)\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards from Germany!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/98","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/98/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/98/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/honojs/middleware/issues/98/events","html_url":"https://github.com/honojs/middleware/issues/98","id":1774212982,"node_id":"I_kwDOIOtRMc5pwFd2","number":98,"title":"Zod Validator","user":{"login":"clarknova","id":63824317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODI0MzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63824317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova","html_url":"https://github.com/clarknova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarknova/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2023-06-26T08:20:36Z","updated_at":"2023-09-30T22:30:25Z","closed_at":"2023-09-19T21:15:34Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When I use zValidator for validation I encounter a typescript bug.\r\nWhen I coerce something inside the validator the resulting type is always never.\r\n` \r\nz.object({quality: z.coerce.number().min(1).max(100)})\r\n`\r\nSo the validation works and the incoming c.req.valid is also correct.

I've encountered an issue with a type mismatch when trying to use the zValidator middleware from the @hono/zod-validator package with Hono. The error occurs when passing the middleware to app.post().\r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to thank you for creating such a great library :pray:. Here's the code snippet to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { zValidator } from '@hono/zod-validator';\r\nimport { z } from 'zod';\r\nconst app = new Hono<{ Bindings: Bindings; Variables: { sentry: Toucan; tenantId: string; } }>();\r\n\r\nconst postBalanceValidator = zValidator('form', z.object({ amount: z.number() }));\r\napp.post(\r\n  '/balance',\r\n  postBalanceValidator, // <-- ERROR HERE\r\n  (c) => addBalance(c)\r\n);\r\n```\r\nThe TypeScript compiler reports the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nこの呼び出しに一致するオーバーロードはありません。\r\n  前回のオーバーロードにより、次のエラーが発生しました。\r\n    型 'MiddlewareHandler<Env, string, { in: { form: { amount: number; }; }; out: { form: { amount: number; }; }; }>' の引数を型 'H<{ Bindings: Bindings; Variables: { sentry: Toucan;tenantId: string; } ; }, string, Input, {}>' のパラメーターに割り当てることはできません。\r\n      型 'MiddlewareHandler<Env, string, { in: { form: { amount: number; }; }; out: { form: { amount: number; }; }; }>' を型 'MiddlewareHandler<{ Bindings: Bindings; Variables: { sentry: Toucan;tenantId: string; } ; }, string, Input>' に割り当てることはできません。\r\n        パラメーター 'c' および 'c' は型に互換性がありません。\r\n          型 'Context<{ Bindings: Bindings; Variables: { sentry: Toucan;tenantId: string; } ; }, string, Input>' を型 'Context<Env, string, { in: { form: { amount: number; }; }; out: { form: { amount: number; }; }; }>' に割り当てることはできません。\r\n            型 'Env' を型 '{ Bindings: Bindings; Variables: { sentry: Toucan;tenantId: string; } ; }' に割り当てることはでき\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour help would be greatly appreciated!
